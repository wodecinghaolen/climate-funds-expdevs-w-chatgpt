The component is a working. It is a dialog that contains a select menu, a text area to display selected text, and buttons to save and cancel.

We have a very similar component with different libraries used to build the dialog and all its functionalities.

The GPT did not provide me with major broken code at the start (other than a bug in the imports) which is pretty surprising to me. It followed
my instruction and added everything I need for the dialog. There's no main struggles.

Impressive and easy to work with.
